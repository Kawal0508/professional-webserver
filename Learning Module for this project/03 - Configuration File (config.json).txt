‚öôÔ∏è CONFIGURATION FILE EXPLANATION (config.json)
===============================================

üìù WHAT IS A CONFIGURATION FILE?
=================================
Think of it like the settings menu in a video game or app. Instead of changing code every time you want to modify how the server works, you just change this file!

It's like having a control panel for your web server.

üîß WHAT DOES EACH SECTION DO?
=============================

1. SERVER SETTINGS
   {
     "server": {
       "host": "0.0.0.0",           ‚Üê What address to listen on (0.0.0.0 = all addresses)
       "port": 8080,                ‚Üê What port number to use (like a door number)
       "max_connections": 100,      ‚Üê How many people can connect at once
       "timeout": 30,               ‚Üê How long to wait before giving up (seconds)
       "thread_pool_size": 10       ‚Üê How many workers to have ready
     }
   }

   SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
   - host: Like choosing which door of your house to answer
   - port: Like a specific door number (8080 is like apartment 8080)
   - max_connections: Like having 100 chairs in your restaurant
   - timeout: If someone takes too long, move on to the next person
   - thread_pool_size: Like having 10 waiters ready to serve

2. SECURITY SETTINGS
   {
     "security": {
       "rate_limit": 100,                    ‚Üê How many requests per minute per person
       "max_file_size": 10485760,           ‚Üê Biggest file allowed (10MB)
       "allowed_methods": ["GET", "HEAD", "POST"],  ‚Üê What actions are allowed
       "cors_enabled": true,                ‚Üê Allow websites to talk to each other
       "cors_origins": ["*"]                ‚Üê Which websites can talk to yours
     }
   }

   SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
   - rate_limit: Like saying "you can only ask for 100 things per minute"
   - max_file_size: Like saying "no files bigger than 10MB"
   - allowed_methods: Like saying "you can only GET, HEAD, or POST"
   - cors_enabled: Like allowing other websites to visit yours
   - cors_origins: Like saying "any website can visit" (* means all)

3. LOGGING SETTINGS
   {
     "logging": {
       "level": "INFO",                     ‚Üê How much detail to record
       "format": "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s",  ‚Üê How to format logs
       "file": "webserver.log"              ‚Üê Where to save the log file
     }
   }

   SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
   - level: Like choosing how much detail to write in a diary
     * DEBUG = everything (very detailed)
     * INFO = important things (normal)
     * WARNING = problems (less detail)
     * ERROR = only errors (minimal)
   - format: Like choosing how to write dates and times
   - file: Like choosing which notebook to write in

4. CACHE SETTINGS
   {
     "cache": {
       "enabled": true,                     ‚Üê Turn caching on/off
       "max_size": 1000,                   ‚Üê How many files to keep in memory
       "ttl": 3600                         ‚Üê How long to keep files (seconds)
     }
   }

   SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
   - enabled: Like turning on/off a fast storage closet
   - max_size: Like saying "keep only 1000 items in the fast storage"
   - ttl: Like saying "throw away items after 1 hour" (3600 seconds = 1 hour)

5. SSL SETTINGS
   {
     "ssl": {
       "enabled": false,                   ‚Üê Turn HTTPS on/off
       "cert_file": null,                  ‚Üê Path to security certificate
       "key_file": null                    ‚Üê Path to security key
     }
   }

   SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
   - enabled: Like turning on/off the security lock
   - cert_file: Like having a security certificate (like an ID card)
   - key_file: Like having a security key (like a password)

üí° WHY USE A CONFIGURATION FILE?
=================================

BEFORE (Hard-coded settings):
- To change port from 8080 to 9000, you had to edit the code
- To change security settings, you had to edit the code
- Every change required programming knowledge
- Risk of breaking the code

AFTER (Configuration file):
- Change port from 8080 to 9000? Just edit the JSON file!
- Change security settings? Just edit the JSON file!
- No programming knowledge needed
- Can't break the code by changing settings

üéØ REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:
======================

DEVELOPMENT (testing):
- port: 8080
- rate_limit: 50
- logging: DEBUG
- ssl: false

PRODUCTION (live website):
- port: 443
- rate_limit: 1000
- logging: INFO
- ssl: true

Same code, different settings! Just change the config file!

üîß HOW TO USE IT:
=================

1. Edit the config.json file with any text editor
2. Change the values you want
3. Restart the server
4. New settings take effect immediately!

EXAMPLE CHANGES:
- Want more security? Increase rate_limit
- Want faster responses? Enable caching
- Want to see more details? Change logging level to DEBUG
- Want HTTPS? Enable SSL and add certificate files

This makes your server flexible and professional!
