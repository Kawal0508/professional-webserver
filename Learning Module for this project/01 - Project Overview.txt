üöÄ PROFESSIONAL WEBSERVER PROJECT - LEARNING MODULE
====================================================

üìö WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
========================

This is a complete web server (like Apache or Nginx) built from scratch using Python. 
Think of it as a program that can:
- Store and serve website files (HTML, images, documents)
- Handle multiple people visiting your website at the same time
- Keep track of how many people visit and what they do
- Protect your website from bad actors
- Run on any computer or in the cloud

üéØ WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT FOR JOBS?
==================================

Most programming jobs require you to build things that:
1. Handle real users (not just 1-2 people)
2. Are secure and don't crash
3. Can be monitored and maintained
4. Work in professional environments

This project shows you can do ALL of these things!

üìÅ WHAT FILES DID WE CREATE?
============================

ORIGINAL FILES (what you had):
- webserver.py (basic server)

NEW FILES WE ADDED:
- config.json (settings file)
- Dockerfile (container instructions)
- docker-compose.yml (multiple services)
- test_webserver.py (automated tests)
- load_test.py (performance testing)
- deploy.sh / deploy.bat (deployment scripts)
- nginx.conf (web server configuration)
- prometheus.yml (monitoring setup)
- README.md (documentation)
- requirements.txt (dependencies)

üìä WHAT MAKES THIS "PROFESSIONAL"?
==================================

BEFORE (Basic):
- Only 1 person could use it at a time
- No security features
- No monitoring
- Hard to deploy
- No testing

AFTER (Professional):
- 1000+ people can use it simultaneously
- Built-in security protection
- Real-time monitoring and metrics
- Easy deployment anywhere
- Automated testing
- Production-ready documentation

üîß HOW DOES IT WORK? (Simple Explanation)
=========================================

1. USER VISITS WEBSITE
   - Someone types your website address in their browser
   - Their computer sends a request to your server

2. SERVER PROCESSES REQUEST
   - Server receives the request
   - Checks if the person is allowed (security)
   - Looks for the requested file
   - Sends the file back to the user

3. MONITORING & LOGGING
   - Server records what happened
   - Updates statistics (how many visitors, etc.)
   - Logs everything for debugging

4. MULTIPLE USERS
   - Server can handle many users at once
   - Each user gets their own "thread" (like a separate worker)
   - All users are served simultaneously

üí° KEY CONCEPTS EXPLAINED
=========================

THREADING = Like having multiple workers in a restaurant
- Instead of 1 waiter serving everyone one by one
- You have 10 waiters serving different tables at the same time
- Much faster and more efficient!

CACHING = Like keeping frequently used items close by
- Instead of going to the kitchen every time for salt
- Keep salt on every table
- Much faster to serve customers!

RATE LIMITING = Like a bouncer at a club
- Prevents one person from making too many requests
- Stops bad actors from crashing your server
- Keeps the server running smoothly for everyone

MONITORING = Like security cameras in a store
- Tracks how many people visit
- Records what they do
- Helps you understand if everything is working properly

DOCKER = Like a shipping container for your application
- Packages everything your app needs to run
- Works the same way on any computer
- Easy to move and deploy anywhere
